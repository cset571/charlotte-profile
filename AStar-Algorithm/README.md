# A* Scheduler

This was a team project where we were tasked in trying to sort tasks onto processors to create the most optimal schedule possible in the shortest amount of time. My primary role in this project was designing and implementing the scheduler and later facilitating parallism in the scheduler.

Through this project, I explored how different optimisation and pruning techniques could be applied to make the search both faster and more memory-efficient.

Our team received the award for Best Overall Scheduler in the class.
