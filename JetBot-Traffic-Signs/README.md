# jetbot-traffic-sign-ai

This project involved working with a NVIDIA Jetson Nano robot. The goal was to train the robot so it could successfully complete a loop around a circuit with different traffic signs and respond correctly to each sign. The signs included:
- Stop sign: robot stops for three seconds, then continues
- Slow down sign: robot reduces speed and returns to original speed after passing a stop sign
- Green traffic light: robot continues moving
- Yellow traffic light: robot stops until the light turns green
- Sheep: robot stops until the sheep is out of frame

This project involved a lot of iterations of data collection, data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and general code which could control the robot.
  
This was a group project and I was involved in every step of the implementation, with a focus on data preprocessing, model training, and integrating the AI with the robot’s control system.
  
Through this project, I learned that integrating AI into hardware is significantly more complex than software alone, requiring careful iteration, testing, and data preprocessing to achieve reliable results.

A video of the functioning robot has been uploaded in this folder.
