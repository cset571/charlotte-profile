# Control-X Irrigator Management App

I grew up in rural Central Hawke’s Bay on a beef and cropping farm and helping my parents on the farm was a part of my childhood. While home from university my dad told me many farmers were having a problem with their pivot irrigation systems. As soil conditions can vary across a paddock and farmers may plant different crops across a single field many of them wish to water certain parts of their field more than other parts. Unfortunately the only way to do this is by putting the irrigator on the slowest speed for the entire rotation which is very inefficient and causes loss in yield. This is because the company that offers variable rate irrigation outputs an electrical signal and the irrigator is driven by command strings which change the hydraulics and no successful adapter exists. Additionally, farmers could only control their irrigator from the centre point of the irrigator.

That is when we had the idea of reaching out to Resolve Water, the New Zealand agent for TL irrigators, and pitching them the idea of creating an adapter to enable efficient variable rate irrigation, and a mobile control system for their irrigators.

To create the variable rate irrigation adapter, I needed to work with electrical signals, and program hardware (a Teltonika RUT956). To implement a mobile control system, I needed to create a mobile website which showed the position of the irrigator in the field from capturing the irrigator’s output status every few seconds, and a way for the farmer to send commands to the irrigator remotely. I coded this website using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, and an SQL database. I also used a PWA wrapper so the website can be used like an app.

This project is still ongoing; the demand from farmers is increasing and alternate hardware options are being explored as well as an actual mobile app.

Overall, this project has taught me many skills from electrical and electronic knowledge, hardware, databases, networking, and web development, to working with end users and clients.

In this folder are some screenshots of the mobile website I have developed and the RUT956 variable rate irrigation adapter.
