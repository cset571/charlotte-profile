# FPGA-Flappy-Bird

This has been one of my favourite projects, involving the development of a custom Flappy Bird game on an FPGA.

To create a successful game, VHDL components were carefully designed and optimized to fully utilize the FPGA while keeping compile times manageable.

The game also features custom graphics, implemented by encoding images with red, green, blue, and transparent values, along with a Python tool to convert standard images into this format for the FPGA display.
