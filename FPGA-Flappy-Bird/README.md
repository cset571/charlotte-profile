# FPGA-Flappy-Bird

This has been one of my favourite projects, involving the development of a custom Flappy Bird game on an FPGA.

To create a successful game, I designed and implemented multiple VHDL modules, such as those controlling the bird’s movement, pipe generation and movement, collision detection, display output, and general game and scoring logic. I made use of Finite State Machines (FSMs) and block diagrams to organise timing, component interaction, and game logic. The design was optimised to make efficient use of FPGA resources while keeping compile times manageable.

The game also features custom graphics, implemented by encoding images with red, green, blue, and transparent values, along with a Python tool to convert standard images into this format for the FPGA display.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of digital design, hardware constraints, and the process of translating software logic into hardware behaviour.
